* Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your project, write main html in. **Do not create index.html file!**
* Create `index.html` in first page of repo and start coding.
* Don't create any `.html` file anywhere and write code in `readme.md`. Use markdown language to customise your webpage.
